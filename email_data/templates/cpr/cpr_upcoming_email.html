<p>Hello {{name}},</p>
<p>This is just an informational email and does not require a reply or action at this time.</p>
<p>According to our records, your CPR/First Aid is coming due on <strong>{{due_date}}</strong>.</p>
<p>We will sign you up to complete this requirement through us unless you provide a more current certificate to either the Training Department or your supervisor before your due date.</p>
<p>Currently we are completing the 1 Year Provisional CPR/First Aid course through Red Cross online. After completing this course you will get a certificate valid for 1 year, with a in person skill session to happen before it expires. Once the skill session is complete your expiration date will be extended beyond 1 year.</p>
<p>The tentative start date for you course is: {{opening_date}}
    <br>This is the date you would get all the information necessary to get started completing the course.</p>
<p>The class would close: {{close_date}}</p>
<p>As long as your CPR/First Aid was completed in that timeframe (or before) you will remain current.</p>
<p>I have cc'd your listed supervisor so they are aware you're coming due.</p>
<p>Please reach out if you have any questions,</p>
<p>{{signature}}</p>
