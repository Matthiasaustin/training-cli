Hello {{name}},

This is just an informational email and does not require a reply or action at this time.

According to our records, your CPR/First Aid is coming due on {{due_date}}.

We will sign you up to complete this requirement through us unless you provide a more current certificate to either the Training Department or your supervisor before your due date.

Currently we are completing the 1 Year Provisional CPR/First Aid course through Red Cross online. After completing this course you will get a certficate valid for 1 year, with a in person skill session to happen before it expires. Once the skill session is complete your expiration date will be extended beyond 1 year. 

The tentative start date for you course is: {{opening_date}}
This is the date you would get all the information necessary to get started completing the course.

The class would close: {{close_date}}

As long as your CPR/First Aid was completed in that timeframe (or before) you will remain current. 

I have cc'd your listed supervisor so they are aware you're coming due.

Please reach out if you have any questions,
