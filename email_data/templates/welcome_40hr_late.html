    <p>Starting today you will begin to be assigned the essential trainings you are required to complete as a Direct Support Professional (DSP). Attached to this message is a syllabus with the details and other expectations. In summary, you will be assigned up to 40 hours of course work to complete in the month of {{month}}.
