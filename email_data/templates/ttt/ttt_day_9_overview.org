Hey all,

This is just a quick reminder of what we're doing today and when we're scheduled to start tomorrow.

Reminder:

No afternoon checkin today. You should spend this time finishing any outstanding work (chapter reviews, recordings, discussions, etc), prepare for Trainer Idol, and finish/submit your Asynchronous class plan. You might want to rehearse for your Trainer Idol teachback with someone from one of your small groups, though totally optional.

Teachbacks should be planned wrap up after about 5 minutes and don't forget to practice how you're going to actually present it on the day!

We will meet together again Friday at 10:00 am. I'll be available for questions or to just talk from 9:15 onwards in the same Zoom link as usual. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
