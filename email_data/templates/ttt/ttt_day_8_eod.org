Hey all,

Just a reminder of what you should have done by the end of day:

 - Read through the materials for Chapter 12 and complete your review activities. Results should be posted online.
 - Meet with your group and do some teachbacks from the chapter.
 - Meet all together between 3:00 pm and 4:00pm. Zoom Link: {{zoom_link}}
 - Record a teachback from the chapter and post online.
 - Complete the end of day discussion questions.


  Reminder:

  No afternoon check-in tomorrow. You should spend this time:
  - Finishing any outstanding work (chapter reviews, recordings, discussions, etc)
  - Preparing for Trainer Idol
  - Finish/submit your flipped classroom plan.

    You might want to rehearse for your Trainer Idol teachback with someone from one of your small groups, though totally optional.

  Teachbacks should be planned wrap up after about 5 minutes and don't forget to practice how you're going to actually present it on the day!

  We will meet together again Friday at 10:00 am. I'll be available for questions or to just talk from 9:15 onwards in the same Zoom link as usual. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
