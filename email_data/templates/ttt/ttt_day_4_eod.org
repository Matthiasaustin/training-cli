Hey all,


Below is a recap of what you should have complete today:
  
- Read through the materials for Chapters 8 & 9 and complete the review activities. Results can be posted online.
- Meet with your group and do some teachbacks from the today’s chapters. Remember to pick a section or activity from each chapter and try not to repeat them in your group. 
- Record a teachback from today’s chapters and post online. Give some feedback to a recorded teachback from your small group as well. Make sure everyone gets some feedback!
- Complete the end of day discussion questions.

Day 5 (Friday)

Our last day this week is a little different than the others. All of you have been puttin in a ton of work this week, both for this class and in many cases other areas of your job as well.

Friday we are just doing two things:
 - Independent review of Chapter 7
 - Meet in your small group to do one teach back each from the chapter and give some feedback.

We will not have an afternoon check in, recorded teachback or any discussion questions. If you are missing any of the work required so far, like your chapter reviews, recorded teachbacks or discussion question responses, please make sure these get uploaded and one before we meet on Monday.

Day 6 (Monday)

We'll be covering Chapters 10 and 11 and it will mirror our normal pattern. I'll send a reminder out Monday morning with more information!

I hope everyone has a great weekend, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!
