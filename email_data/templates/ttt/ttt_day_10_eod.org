Hey {{name}},

I wanted to first say thank you for attending and being a great contributor to our class. You are going to make a great trainer.

As you get back into your normal role and/or get started training please feel free to reach out with any questions you might have.

Attached you'll find a certificate of completion that doubles as CE credit for this year. Make sure to file it with your agency and keep a copy for your personal records as well.

Below is a (quite long) link for a survey, as well as the event number that indicates the training. Please take some time to fill it out and give your feedback on the training. The survey helps DDA know if I'm serving you well as an instructor. Details below:
