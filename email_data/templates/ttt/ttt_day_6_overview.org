Good Morning Everyone!

I hope you had a good weekend.

Today we are working on chapters 10 and 11. We'll use the same pattern as before. I've outlined it again below:

 - Read through the materials for Chapters 10 & 11 and complete your review activities. Results should be posted online.
 - Meet with your group and do some teachbacks from the today’s chapters.
 - Meet all together between 3:00 pm and 4:00pm. Zoom Link: {{zoom_link}}
 - Record a teachback from today’s chapters and post online.
 - Complete the end of day discussion questions.

Please reach out with any questions!
