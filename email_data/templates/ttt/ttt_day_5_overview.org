Good Morning all,

This message is just a quick reminder for you on what is happening today:
- Complete your review of chapter 7 and post the results of your review activity.
- Meet with your small group at the agreed on time. Please don't forget to schedule your meeting time for Monday during this time as well!

That's it!

If you have any work you're still finishing from earlier in the week please make sure that gets finished before Monday. Otherwise, have a fantastic weekend!

Reach out with any questions you have!
