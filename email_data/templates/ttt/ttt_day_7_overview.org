Good Morning All,

Today we are working on chapters 13 and 14. We'll use the same pattern as before. I've outlined it again below:

 - Read through the materials for Chapters 13 & 14 and complete your review activities. Results should be posted online.
 - Meet with your group and do some teachbacks from the today’s chapters.
 - Meet all together between 3:00 pm and 4:00pm. Zoom Link: {{zoom_link}}
 - Record a teachback from today’s chapters and post online.
 - Complete the end of day discussion questions.

Please also talk to your co-workers in the class (i.e. you all work at the same company) and let me know a time we can meet on Wednesday ahead of our check-in at 3 pm. We'll take about a half hour per group. 

Let me know if you have any questions and see you at 3:00 pm!
