Hey {{name}},

I wanted to first say thank you for attending and being a great contributor to our class. You are going to make a great trainer.

As you get back into your normal role and/or get started training please feel free to reach out with any questions you might have.

Attached you'll find a certificate of completion that doubles as CE credit for this year. Make sure to file it with your agency and keep a copy for your personal records as well.

If you havenâ€™t had a chance, please take this end of class survey (Event Number: DDA21-1040)!

Have a fantastic week and beginning of your journey training the 40hr CORE.
