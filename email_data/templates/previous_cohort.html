<p>Hello {{name}},</p>
<p>This is an update on your progress through the online 40hr CORE, as well a reminder that if you are receiving this message you have some work remaining to complete.</p>

<p>The cohort you started these trainings with is finished but in order to remain on the schedule they must be completed. Below is a summary of your progress as of this update and instructions on how to receive credit on your time card for courses you have completed since the last update.</p>

<p>Progress to date: {{update_info}}</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to submit a punch change request through Paycom in order to receive credit for any chapters you've completed.</strong> Your supervisor cannot do this for you. The hours to submit for are noted below. Since everyone progresses at different rates the hours awarded by chapter are the same as the hours DDA credits the courses. These can be found in the syllabus. Each update email will include a reminder to submit for these hours as well as the number of hours earned since the last review. Attached you will find instructions for how to request these hours.</p>

<p><strong>Hours earned since last check: {{hours_completed}}</strong></p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions,</p>
